EasyPageComments

This projects aims to make the concept of
quickly adding a comments section to pages
trivial, by offering a PHP script 
(EasyPageCommentsphp) that takes care of
the message administration (using PDO-SQLite
for storage) as well as the content generation.

This can either be injected into pages
by letting the server add them, using:

  print $EasyPageComments->createCommentsList()

and:

  print $EasyPageComments->createCommentForm()

Or, optionally, by adding the comments on-the-fly
using JavaScritp, fetching the comments list
and comment posting form using AJAX calls.

This is relatively simple to write yourself,
but to make matters even easier a JS script
(EasyPageComments.js) is also offered, so
that the comments and post form can be injected
client-side, using:

  var commentsHTML = EasyPageComments.createCommentsList();

and:

  var postForm = EasyPageComments.createCommentForm();

I'm still figuring out the precise license for this.
Basically you're free to use it however you want, but
if you're using it on sites in a way that allows you
to make more money, a donation would be fair.

If you want to include it with a for-sale commercial
product, contact me first.
