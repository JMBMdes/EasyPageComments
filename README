  ================================

This projects aims to make the concept of quickly adding a
comments section to pages trivial, by offering a PHP script
(EasyPageCommentsphp) that takes care of the message
administration (using PDO-SQLite for storage) as well as
the content generation. An explanation can be found on:

I'm still figuring out the precise license for this.
Basically you're free to use it however you want, but if
you're using it on sites in a way that allows you to make
more money, a donation would be fair.

If you want to include it with a for-sale commercial
product, contact me first.
